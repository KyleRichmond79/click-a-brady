        <p>Hello, My name is Kyle Richmond and I am originally from Fort Wayne, IN. I have lived in Seattle for a little over 4 years now. I am a hobbiest gamer and I enjoy table top RPGs and LARPs. I have very little coding experience in my past other than some very basic HTML from Angelfire and Geocities chat rooms. I am excited to be learning coding and looking forward to seeing where my coding path takes me. One of my goals is to be able to create a website, for one of the LARPs I created, that will allow a player to Created and manage that character, have an in game store, bank, and functioning "hacking game". You can see more about me <a href="https://kylerichmond79.github.io/about-me/">here</a>.</p>
