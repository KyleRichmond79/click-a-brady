          <p> My name is Gaby, Iâ€™m from Venezuela. I have a law degree and a couple of masters related to tax law and finance. I moved to Seattle recently, this past December. Before moving here, I lived in Spain for 7 years and Mexico for 2 years. This is my first time living in a 100% English language environment. I choose to start to coding as a way to create a new path where I can live wherever I want without the limitations that a Law career brings. Why code? I love to be creative and I think coding gives you the tools to build whatever you have in mind.<p> My first Code Fellow project<a href="https://brunella10.github.io/about-me-101/"> here </a></p>

          <p> Nice to meet you! I'm Katherine Hanson, a former-Product-Manager-turned-student working avidly in my quest to become a full-stack dev. I started learning the nuts and bolts of programming in order to better communicate with my company's devs about the technical side of the development process, and found I enjoyed using the math portion of my brain to think through algorithms enough that I wanted to pursue it as a career. My hobbies include reading, nerding out over anime and manga, games, fashion, biking, and trying out new and interesting-sounding technologies.

          <p> Hello, My name is Kyle Richmond and I am originally from Fort Wayne, IN. I have lived in Seattle for a little over 4 years now. I am a hobbyist gamer and I enjoy table top RPGs and LARPs. I have very little coding experience in my past other than some very basic HTML from Angelfire and Geocities chat rooms. I am excited to be learning coding and looking forward to seeing where my coding path takes me. One of my goals is to be able to create a website for one of the LARPs I created, that will allow a player to Creat and manage their character, have an in game store, bank, and functioning "hacking game". You can see more about me <a href="https://kylerichmond79.github.io/about-me/">here</a>.</p>

          <p> My name is Zach, I used to be a medic in the U.S. Army, but was interested in learning more about computers. I moved home to Hawaii and realized while in college, I wasn't learning any of the things that I was originally interested in. I looked into programs that had the knowledge I wanted to gain, and stumbled across Code Fellows. I've enjoyed the program thus far, and look forward to 301!</p>
